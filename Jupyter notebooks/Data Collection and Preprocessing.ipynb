    "## Data Preparation Process: Key Economic Indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the data preparation process for analyzing key economic indicators, I began by collecting data from **FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)**, an essential repository for economic datasets. This task required connecting to the **FRED API** using my unique API key, enabling seamless access to various economic time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Collection  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step was defining the specific economic indicators of interest. I selected six key datasets critical for understanding economic conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Federal Funds Rate (FEDFUNDS)**:  \n",
    "   Represents the interest rate at which banks lend to each other overnight, providing a direct measure of monetary policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Consumer Price Index (CPIAUCSL)**:  \n",
    "   A vital indicator for inflation, showing changes in the purchasing power of money over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Unemployment Rate (UNRATE)**:  \n",
    "   Reflects the health of the labor market and the percentage of the labor force currently without work.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**:  \n",
    "   Measures the economy's overall size and health, recorded quarterly.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Nonfarm Payrolls (PAYEMS)**:  \n",
    "   A key indicator of employment trends, representing the number of employed workers in various sectors (excluding farming).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Industrial Production Index (INDPRO)**:  \n",
    "   Tracks changes in the output of industrial sectors like manufacturing, mining, and utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "I set the **date range** to span from **January 2000 to the present**, ensuring comprehensive coverage of historical and recent economic activity. Each series was downloaded from FRED and stored as a separate DataFrame with a **timestamp index** for temporal alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Processing and Alignment  \n",
    "\n",
    "The data from FRED came in **varying frequencies**—monthly for most indicators but quarterly for GDP. To create a consistent dataset for analysis, I:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reindexed** all series to match a **monthly frequency**.  \n",
    "- For **GDP**, which naturally has a quarterly frequency, I applied **forward-filling** to propagate each quarter's value across its respective months.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve clarity and usability:  \n",
    "- I **renamed columns** for better readability:  \n",
    "   - `FEDFUNDS` → `fed_funds_rate`  \n",
    "   - `CPIAUCSL` → `cpi`  \n",
    "   - `UNRATE` → `unemployment`  \n",
    "\n",
    "Any **missing values** were forward-filled to maintain continuity and prevent gaps in the analysis. The clean, aligned dataset was then saved as:  \n",
    "**`economic_indicators_2000_present_monthly.csv`**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Transformation  \n",
    "\n",
    "With the initial dataset prepared, I performed several transformations to make the data more interpretable and analysis-ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Unit Conversions**  \n",
    "- **GDP** values, originally recorded in billions, were converted to **trillions** for consistency with macroeconomic reporting.  \n",
    "- **Nonfarm Payrolls**, expressed in thousands, were converted to **millions**, a more intuitive scale for employment analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Growth Rates**  \n",
    "To capture dynamic changes in key indicators, I calculated **Month-over-Month (MoM)** percentage growth rates for:  \n",
    "- **CPI (Consumer Price Index)**: Measuring inflation changes over time.  \n",
    "- **Industrial Production Index**: Reflecting fluctuations in industrial output.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These growth rates provided insights into how inflation and industrial activity evolved month to month.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Cleaning Data**  \n",
    "Rows with **NaN values** arising from the percentage change calculations (e.g., the first row of each series) were dropped to ensure a clean dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Dataset Preparation  \n",
    "\n",
    "The final dataset included:  \n",
    "- **Original indicators**  \n",
    "- **Derived metrics** like **growth rates**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting well-structured and transformed dataset was saved as:  \n",
    "**`economic_indicators_transformed.csv`**  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary  \n",

    "## FOMC Statement Analysis Process\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identifying the Official Source  \n",
    "I began by locating the **Federal Reserve’s official website**, where historical FOMC statements are published after each meeting. This ensured that all data was sourced from an **authentic and reliable source**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Manual Download of Raw Files  \n",
    "The next step involved:  \n",
    "- **Manually downloading** FOMC statements corresponding to each meeting date directly from the Fed’s website.  \n",
    "- The statements were initially available in **HTML format** (or other provided formats).  \n",
    "- All files were saved into a dedicated local folder: **`fomc_statements_texts`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extracting Plain Text from HTML  \n",
    "To extract the relevant content:  \n",
    "- I used **Python scripts** leveraging the `requests` library to fetch the HTML files and **BeautifulSoup** to parse them.  \n",
    "- The scripts isolated the **main textual content** of each statement while removing:  \n",
    "   - Headers, navigation menus, and footers  \n",
    "   - Any irrelevant or boilerplate sections  \n",
    "\n",
    "This process ensured that only the **core content** of each statement was retained.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning and Normalizing the Text  \n",
    "Once the plain text was extracted:  \n",
    "- I cleaned the text by:  \n",
    "   - Removing **duplicate paragraphs** and **excessive whitespace**  \n",
    "   - Eliminating repetitive or irrelevant sections (e.g., boilerplate text)  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The cleaned versions of the statements were saved in **`.txt` format** into a new directory: **`fomc_statements_texts_cleaned`**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Qualitative Analysis Using OpenAI Models  \n",
    "For a deeper understanding of the FOMC statements:  \n",
    "- Each cleaned `.txt` file was sent to the **OpenAI API** (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo` or `gpt-4`) using a carefully designed **prompt**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- I requested a **structured JSON output** that included:  \n",
    "   - **Policy stance**: Hawkish, Dovish, or Neutral  \n",
    "   - **Overall sentiment**: Positive, Negative, or Neutral  \n",
    "   - **Numerical sentiment score**: A value between **-1 and 1**  \n",
    "   - **Tone-related keywords**: e.g., “cautious”, “accommodative”  \n",
    "   - **Key economic concerns** mentioned in the statement  \n",
    "   - **Forward guidance indications**  \n",
    "   - **A short summary** of the statement  \n",
    "\n",
    "This structured output provided a rich, qualitative assessment of each FOMC statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storing Results in a Centralized File  \n",
    "The final step involved:  \n",
    "- Parsing the **JSON responses** generated by the OpenAI model.  \n",
    "- Aggregating all extracted features into a single **tabular format**.  \n",
    "- The results were saved into an **Excel** or **CSV file**:  \n",
    "   **`fomc_sentiment_analysis_results.xlsx`**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This centralized file contained all qualitative insights, neatly organized for further analysis or modeling.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary  \n",
    "By following this process, I transformed raw FOMC statements into a **cleaned, structured dataset** enriched with **policy stance, sentiment scores, tone analysis**, and **key economic insights**. This dataset forms a strong foundation for understanding the FOMC’s decisions and their potential implications on monetary policy.\n"

    "## Global Economic Indicators Data Acquisition and Preparation  \n",
    "\n",
    "To complement the U.S. domestic economic and FOMC statement data, I incorporated **global economic indicators** from the **World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI)**. My goal was to contextualize the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions within a broader international economic environment. The following process outlines the detailed steps I followed:  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rationale for Data Selection  \n",
    "\n",
    "The U.S. economy and monetary policy are often influenced by **global economic conditions**. Changes in foreign GDP growth, inflation, and labor market performance can indirectly affect U.S. exports, imports, commodity prices, and financial markets. Therefore, I aimed to gather a **small but representative set of global indicators** to capture this international dimension.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing Countries  \n",
    "\n",
    "I selected countries that are either top U.S. trading partners or significant global economies capable of influencing worldwide economic trends. Specifically, I chose:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Canada and Mexico**: As immediate neighbors and leading U.S. trading partners, their economic performance can quickly impact U.S. markets.  \n",
    "- **China**: A major global economic powerhouse and key U.S. trading partner, China’s economic shifts influence global supply chains and price levels.  \n",
    "- **Japan, Germany, the UK, and other European economies** (France, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Switzerland): Including these advanced economies provides a broader perspective on the international environment. Their stable data and significant financial and trade linkages reveal global trends that may affect U.S. monetary policy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By selecting this **mix of North American, European, and Asian economies**, I ensured a well-rounded view of external economic conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing Indicators  \n",
    "\n",
    "To capture relevant macroeconomic trends, I focused on key indicators commonly used to gauge economic health:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **GDP Growth (annual %)**: Reflects economic momentum. Higher global growth could increase demand for U.S. exports or influence commodity prices.  \n",
    "- **Inflation, Consumer Prices (annual %)**: Tracking global inflation trends helps identify external inflationary pressures that might spill over into the U.S.  \n",
    "- **Unemployment (% of total labor force)**: Provides insights into global labor market conditions, affecting consumer demand, trade flows, and overall economic stability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Source and Tools  \n",
    "\n",
    "I accessed the **World Bank’s WDI database** programmatically using the **`wbgapi` Python package**. This allowed me to query and download the selected indicators seamlessly for the chosen countries over a defined time period (2000 to the present).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Download Process  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **API Query Setup**:  \n",
    "   - I wrote a Python script specifying the **countries**, **indicators**, and the year range (2000 to the current year).  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Downloading Data**:  \n",
    "   - Using WBGAPI functions, I retrieved annual data for each country and indicator. Initially, the data was stored with **years as columns** and **countries as rows**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reshaping and Merging**:  \n",
    "   - I transformed the data so that each row represented a unique combination of **country** and **year**.  \n",
    "   - Additional columns for each chosen indicator were added.  \n",
    "   - The year was converted into a proper **date format** (e.g., YYYY-01-01) for consistency, even though the data remains annual.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Cleaning and Formatting  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensured all indicators were numeric (**float64**) and the date column was interpreted as a **datetime type**.  \n",
    "- No missing values were found, simplifying the cleaning process.  \n",
    "- Dropped any unnecessary columns, such as temporary time columns used during import.  \n",
    "- The final dataset included:  \n",
    "   - **economy**  \n",
    "   - **date**  \n",
    "   - **gdp_growth**  \n",
    "   - **inflation_cpi**  \n",
    "   - **unemployment**  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verification and Validation  \n",
    "\n",
    "After processing, I verified:  \n",
    "- **Data types**: Ensured all columns had correct formats (e.g., date as datetime, indicators as float).  \n",
    "- **Content consistency**: Reviewed the first few rows to confirm the indicators made intuitive sense. GDP growth percentages, inflation rates, and unemployment levels appeared reasonable for the selected countries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion  \n",
    "\n",
    "This process of selecting countries, indicators, and careful data handling produced a **relevant, manageable, and high-quality dataset**. By integrating these **global economic indicators** into my analysis, I enhanced the analytical framework and provided greater context for understanding the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions. This approach also potentially improves the **predictive power** of the forecasting model.\n"

    "## Data Preparation and Alignment for Merging  \n",
    "\n",
    "To seamlessly integrate the three datasets—**FOMC Sentiment Data**, **Economic Indicators Data**, and **World Bank Global Indicators Data**—a series of preprocessing steps were undertaken. These adjustments were essential to align the structure, format, and temporal resolution of the data, ensuring compatibility while maintaining the integrity of the information. Below is a summary of the steps and their rationale.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### FOMC Sentiment Data  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Original Format**:  \n",
    "   - The dataset had irregular dates derived from FOMC statement release schedules, which typically occur every two months.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adjustments Made**:  \n",
    "   - Extracted dates from filenames to create a **merge_date** column in a monthly format.  \n",
    "   - Added missing months to align with the monthly resolution of the other datasets. Missing data was forward-filled to propagate the latest available sentiment and policy stance values.  \n",
    "   - Prefixed all columns with **`fomc_`** to distinguish them from similar indicators in other datasets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reason**:  \n",
    "   - Standardizing the temporal resolution to monthly intervals enabled alignment with the Economic Indicators Data and ensured that no gaps occurred during the merging process.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Economic Indicators Data  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Original Format**:  \n",
    "   - This dataset was already in a **monthly resolution**, containing detailed U.S.-specific economic metrics (e.g., inflation, unemployment, industrial production).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adjustments Made**:  \n",
    "   - Renamed the `date` column to **merge_date** for consistency across datasets.  \n",
    "   - Verified data integrity, ensuring no missing values or inconsistencies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reason**:  \n",
    "   - Minimal adjustments were needed as the dataset was already optimized for analysis and compatible with the merging process.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### World Bank Global Indicators Data  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Original Format**:  \n",
    "   - The dataset contained **annual data** for multiple countries (excluding the U.S.), which required temporal alignment with the other datasets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adjustments Made**:  \n",
    "   - Converted annual data into **monthly resolution** by forward-filling values across months within each year.  \n",
    "   - Added a **merge_date** column to match the temporal resolution of the other datasets.  \n",
    "   - Prefixed all columns with **`global_`** to differentiate global metrics from U.S.-specific data in the Economic Indicators Data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reason**:  \n",
    "   - Aligning the temporal resolution and adding prefixes ensured the integration of global metrics without conflicts or overwriting U.S.-specific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of the Adjustments  \n",
    "\n",
    "These preprocessing steps were critical for creating a unified dataset capable of accurate and comprehensive analysis of economic and policy trends. Without these adjustments:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Temporal Misalignments**:  \n",
    "   - Irregular dates across datasets would have resulted in incomplete or misleading data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Overlapping Column Names**:  \n",
    "   - Duplicate column names could have caused confusion or inaccuracies during analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Missing Data**:  \n",
    "   - Unfilled gaps for specific months would have reduced the effectiveness of downstream machine learning models and statistical analyses.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion  \n",
    "\n",
    "By addressing these challenges, the datasets were successfully prepared for seamless merging. The resulting unified dataset serves as a strong foundation for building predictive models and extracting meaningful insights into the relationship between economic indicators and Federal Reserve interest rate decisions.\n"

    "## Steps for Merging the Datasets  \n",
    "\n",
    "Merging the datasets—**World Bank Data**, **Economic Indicators Data**, and **FOMC Sentiment Data**—was a critical step to create a unified and comprehensive dataset for analysis. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the process:  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Loading the Data  \n",
    "\n",
    "I loaded the three datasets into memory:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **World Bank Data**:  \n",
    "   - Contains global economic indicators, such as GDP growth, inflation, and unemployment, aggregated monthly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Economic Indicators Data**:  \n",
    "   - Provides U.S.-specific metrics like the Federal Funds Rate, unemployment rate, and industrial production data, recorded monthly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **FOMC Sentiment Data**:  \n",
    "   - Includes sentiment analysis results and policy stance derived from FOMC statements, available every two months.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Standardizing the Date Column  \n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare the datasets for merging:  \n",
    "- I ensured the **date column** in all three files was in a consistent format (**datetime64[ns]**).  \n",
    "- This step was crucial because the **merge operation** relies on matching dates across datasets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Filling Missing Months in FOMC Data  \n",
    "\n",
    "The FOMC data lacked entries for certain months due to the bi-monthly schedule of FOMC meetings. To align it with the monthly frequency of the other datasets:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- I applied **forward-fill** to propagate the latest available sentiment and policy stance to subsequent months.  \n",
    "- This ensured that every month had an associated **FOMC stance** and **sentiment score**, making the dataset compatible with the monthly resolution of the others.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Aligning the World Bank Data  \n",
    "\n",
    "The World Bank data was initially provided at an **annual frequency**. To align it with the other datasets:  \n",
    "- I transformed the data to a **monthly resolution** by repeating each annual value across all months of the corresponding year.  \n",
    "- This adjustment allowed for proper alignment with the **monthly data** from the Economic Indicators Data and FOMC Sentiment Data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Outer Join for Merging  \n",
    "\n",
    "To combine the datasets:  \n",
    "- I performed an **outer join** on the `date` column.  \n",
    "- This method preserved all dates from the three datasets, even if one or more sources didn’t have data for a specific month.  \n",
    "- The **outer join** ensured no information was lost during the merging process.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Handling Missing Values  \n",
    "\n",
    "After merging, some missing values were observed, especially for months where a particular source lacked data. To address this:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- I used **forward-fill** to propagate previous values for both **numeric** and **categorical fields**.  \n",
    "- This maintained **continuity** in the data while avoiding artificial fluctuations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary  \n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, I created a unified dataset that integrates **U.S. domestic metrics**, **global economic indicators**, and **FOMC sentiment analysis results**. The resulting dataset preserves temporal consistency, ensures completeness, and provides a robust foundation for subsequent analysis and modeling.\n"
